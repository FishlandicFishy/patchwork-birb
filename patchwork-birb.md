## Disclaimer
This document is entirely a joke, and I do not intend to offend anyone. This document is also cringe.

## Trigger Warning
**Cringe Content.** This is very cringe. External links can be *very* cringeworthy ~~and may cause allergic reactions~~.

## Abstract
This document serves to outline a tabletop game concept, which is intentionally over-complicated and confusing.
Game ideas have been permanently borrowed from numerous sources, including preexisting tabletop games and ideas
from the *Be a Board Game Designer* programme.

## Prerequisites
* A computer, defined as any device that fulfills the Turing Machine definition,
  with the below software installed or readily available:
  * Any text editor.
  * A random number generator.
* A full collection of dice from d1 to d100, with at least one each.
* A digital camera that captures in at least 4K resolution, at a rate of at least 2048 FPS.
* A tabletop game designing kit with its full set of cards.
* A few tables and partitions.
* A substantial amount of paper.
* A working printer deemed as non-scam, as a substantial amount of documents is to be scanned.
  * HP printers are NOT recommended.
  * Printers requiring magenta ink are NOT recommended.
* Optionally a fursuit, preferably one of a fox.

## Basic Info
* At least 12 players, recommended 21 players.
  * The number of players should be divisible by 3.
  * Adjust the number of cards based on the amount of players.
* Age rating: 100+.
  * This rule aims to provide this age group with a form of entertainment, as LEGO prohibits them from using their sets.
  * Players under the required age will be sent to Alligator Alcatraz.
* Without Fishy's prior permission, it is unacceptable to simulate the entire game digitally,
  as it violates our intellectual property. DRM software collectively named "Administrative Measures"
  will be taken to ensure compliance. You can imagine what that means. /s

## Plot (irrelevant to game)
Man is Mary’s rival.
Man had once launched a ["special operation" on Mary, occupying 20% of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).
They both go on a crowded boat which had capsized, barely surviving, and both [go on a submarine which had imploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion), barely surviving again (plot armour).
Meanwhile, you, the player, have been [Fortnite Battle Passed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRWPzZmTT8I) into an
island where you’re forced to [wörk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvANy49Kqhw).
